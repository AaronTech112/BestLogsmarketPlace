        <h1>Store Rules</h1>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>1.</strong> Always secure your accounts immediately after logging in to protect them.</li>

            <li><strong>2.</strong> Once the password is changed, accounts cannot be restored.</li>

            <li><strong>3.</strong> We offer replacements for faulty accounts only if the issue originates from our side, not from user activity.</li>

            <li><strong>4.</strong> These rules may change at any time without notice.</li>

            <li><strong>5.</strong> Using inappropriate language toward our administrators may lead to service denial.</li>

            <li><strong>6.</strong> Not knowing the rules does not exempt users from responsibility.</li>

            <li><strong>7.</strong> Our technical support team is available 24/7 to resolve any issues or inquiries.</li>

            <li><strong>8.</strong> All accounts are thoroughly verified using our proprietary software and mobile proxy to ensure full validity.</li>

            <li><strong>9.</strong> While accounts are non-refundable, they may be replaced if found defective, provided all guidelines are adhered to.</li>

            <li><strong>10.</strong> The store is not liable for any account activity; the functionality of an account depends on its usage. We do not issue replacements or refunds for accounts that are suspended, disabled, or logged out post-login. Only purchase an account if you understand how to use it, as refunds will not be granted for lack of knowledge. However, we are happy to offer tips and support to help you maximize your purchase.</li>

            <li><strong>11.</strong> The store does not provide training or guidance on using accounts. We are responsible only for supplying accounts and not for educating you on their usage or offering related consultations. If you have questions about using accounts, we recommend seeking information from other sources or experts in the field.</li>

            <li><strong>12.</strong> If you intend to use the purchased accounts long-term, it is essential to regularly change passwords and manage account security yourself. This is crucial for safeguarding your interests and preventing unauthorized access. The store is not responsible for security issues related to accounts after purchase.</li>
        </ul>
